# Building a Blockchain in Go

> This is an ongoing tutorial. Please refer to [dev.to](https://dev.to/nheindev/build-the-hello-world-of-blockchain-in-go-bli) for the entire tutorial provided by Noah Hein.

This is a tutorial to serve as a side project to learn a bit about Golang, while also developing a better understand of Blockchain Technology.

The entire tutorial is available at [dev.to](https://dev.to/nheindev/build-the-hello-world-of-blockchain-in-go-bli). All the credits go to Noah Hein, thanks for such a didatic material.

## Organization:

Noah divided the tutorial in 6 parts. Each part will evolve the code base into something closer to real world applications of blockchain.

For the sake of version management and to keep track of the evolution on our code, each step will be stored in a diferent branch. With branch master having the most updated one.

### PT: I - The Hello World of Blockchains

Creating the first structs to handle the Block and the Blockchain.

This part provides a basic understand of how a simple block behaves and how to add multiple blocks to a chain (to form a blockchain).

### PT: II - Proof Of Work

### PT: III - Persistence

### PT: III (extended) - CLI

### PT: IV - Transactions

### Pt V - Wallets
